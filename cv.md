2. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
I am a hard-working, flexible, active and energetic individual who is willing to work both as a team member or as a unique worker. I am ready to meet all the necessary requirements and to adhere to the rules. Ready to improve those skills at any time. I’m always searching for the new standards in the industry so I could learn new skills day by day. 

3. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
Skilled user in Adobe Photoshop & Microsoft Office. I have experience working with CRMs, 1C, WordPress, Unisender, CorelDraw. No programming languages at this time.

4. Experience (for a Junior QA it means all kinds of experience: courses, interesting tasks - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Courses at Solvd. are my first programming courses.

5. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
2016 - 2020 Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics;
     Faculty of Engineering and Economics
International House - English courses

6. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
I started to learn English at school. I’m also taking courses at International House at the moment to expand my knowledge. I practiced it at foreign countries I visited with my family during the past years.
